Mostapha Travel And Tourism Agency [React JS/Tailwind CSS]

<p> A Friend of mine has a Travel And Tourism Agency and wants me to create his website.</p>
<p> RESPONSIVE THINKING, no pixel thinking [JUST clamp, min, max, vw, vh, em, rem, ch..] </p>
<p> I enjoy seeing the website getting responsive on its own, not be changing it for every single screen.
started from scratch: UI.FIGMA then React JS / Tailwind CSS </p>
